  title: Geo Processes Manager API
  description: |
    Airbus Defence and Space "Geo Processes Manager" API specification.

    The processes manager is reponsible for registering, monitoring and
    operating processes.

    A job is a unitary execution of a process.
    
    A process may be an unitary processing or a composition of several tasks.
    In the later case, the tasks workflow management can be specific to the process
    or delegated to the process manager which is also specific to the geo process
    manager implementation. Workflow implementation is not covered by this API.

    Processes have to implement the "Geo Process" API specification.
