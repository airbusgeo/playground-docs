The Intelligence Playground is a Collaborative Platform to create and validate Machine Learning algorithms on Satellite and Aerial Imagery. Here is the link to the Intelligence Playground: [Playground](https://playground.intelligence-airbusds.com). It is currently only open to Airbus entities.

If you are interested to get access to Airbus satellite imagery for prototype and evaluation, please check our Intelligence Sandbox:  [Sandbox](https://sandbox.intelligence-airbusds.com/web/). Otherwise, check our online commercial service on [Intelligence Data](https://oneatlas.airbus.com)

Here, you will find documentation regarding:

* [For users] Using the Intelligence Playground Web Interface
* [For developers] Using the Playground API to connect and launch tasks
* [For partners] Deploying a custom processing in Playground

## Introduction

The Intelligence Playground is a development platform for imagery processing services based on Earth Observation data. The core objective of the Intelligence Playground is to provide a "sandboxed" environment connected to worldwide imagery in order to develop, deploy and test image processing algorithms in a cloud environment. By taking care of data connection, deployment and scalability, it enables data scientists to concentrate on their jobs. In particular, it has been designed to facilitate the development of machine learning algorithms by making it easy to upload a predictor, run inference on large quantities of data, validate each records, benchmark the overall preformance and generate new updated datasets for training.
